🚀 **Project Title & Tagline**
---------------------------

**Project Name:** Time-Based Automation
**Tagline:** Wait until the perfect moment 🕰️

📖 **Description**
----------------

Time-Based Automation is a Python project that explores the concept of automating tasks based on time. This project is designed to showcase the use of Python's built-in datetime module and the pyautogui library to wait until a specific time and then perform a task.

The project consists of four main files: `pause.py`, `script.py`, `install_requirements.py`, and `resume.py`. Each file demonstrates a unique feature of the project, such as waiting until a specific time, installing packages, and resuming a task.

✨ **Features**
----------------

1. **Time-Based Waiting**: The project uses the datetime module to wait until a specific time, allowing for precise automation.
2. **Package Installation**: The `install_requirements.py` file demonstrates how to install packages from a requirements.txt file using pip.
3. **Task Resumption**: The `resume.py` file shows how to resume a task after a specified time.
4. **Scripting**: The `script.py` file provides a basic script that can be used as a starting point for more complex automation tasks.
5. **Error Handling**: The project includes basic error handling to ensure that the script can recover from unexpected errors.
6. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The project uses Python's built-in datetime module, which is compatible with most operating systems.
7. **pip Integration**: The project demonstrates how to use pip to install packages, making it easy to manage dependencies.
8. **Documentation**: The project includes detailed documentation, making it easy to understand and use.

📁 **Project Structure**
-------------------------

* `pause.py`: Demonstrates waiting until a specific time.
* `script.py`: Provides a basic script for automation tasks.
* `install_requirements.py`: Installs packages from a requirements.txt file.
* `resume.py`: Resumes a task after a specified time.
* `get-pip.py`: Installs pip using base85 encoding.

⚙️ **How to Run**
----------------

1. **Setup**: Install Python and pip on your system.
2. **Environment**: Create a new Python environment using a virtual environment tool like virtualenv or conda.
3. **Build**: Install the project dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. **Deploy**: Run the scripts using Python, for example, `python pause.py` or `python install_requirements.py`.

🧪 **Testing Instructions**
-------------------------

1. **Test 1**: Run `python pause.py` and verify that the script waits until 1:00 PM.
2. **Test 2**: Run `python install_requirements.py` and verify that the script installs the required packages.
3. **Test 3**: Run `python resume.py` and verify that the script resumes the task after 2:00 PM.
